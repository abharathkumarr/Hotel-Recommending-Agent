# Hotel Recommending AI Agent

This project demonstrates an AI-powered hotel search and recommendation system. It leverages tools like LangChain, OpenAI, Chroma, Crew AI, and Gradio to build an intelligent system that automatically searches for hotels, reviews them, and suggests the best options based on user input. The system processes large hotel listing data, embeds them into a vector database, and retrieves relevant hotel information based on user queries.


## Overview

This project uses a variety of AI technologies to provide personalized hotel recommendations based on user input, such as location, check-in and check-out dates, number of guests, and budget. By using a series of custom-built agents and tools, the system is able to find and evaluate the best hotel options for a given criteria.
